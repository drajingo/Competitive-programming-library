# Competitive-programming-library
A library of C++ codes for many topics popular in programming competitions

## Description
* This is predominantly *template* code, to be used in programming competitions. Individual files on their own will usually not compile, since the code is not meant to be standalone, but rather be used as/when needed.
* Efficiency is valued much more than readability or good practices.
* Feel free to fork and play with the code according to the terms of the GPL v2.0. Merge requests will be turned down, however, since subtle differences in coding style make someone else's code difficult to use in a time-sensitive environment like a contest.
