# Strings

String algorithms are one field that I've yet to start exploring. Eventually, I hope to have working, efficient, and reasonable-sized implementations of various popular algorithms and data structures including:

* KMP
* Z-Algorithm
* Polynomial Hashing
* Manacher's Algorithm
* Suffix Tree
* Suffix Array
* Suffix Automaton
* Trie
* Rope
